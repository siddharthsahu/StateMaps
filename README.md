# StateMaps (www.statemaps.org)

Transparency of state affairs is key to good governance. It provides metrics against which citizens can evaluate the performance of their government and ask informed questions. There are many organizations which provide insightful data across countries, but there is lots of inequality among states of a country which needs to be highlighted.

StateMaps.org is an effort to highlight this disparity among states of a country. It tries to provide better understanding and insight of data by focusing on the graphical representation. At present, we provide some standard statistics but will strive for more insightful data in due course of time.
